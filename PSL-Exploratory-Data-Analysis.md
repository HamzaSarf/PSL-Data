# Pakistan Super League Exploratory Data Analysis

For the purpose of this exercise, weâ€™ll deploy the very handy
cricketdata package developed by Rob J Hyndman, which gathers data from
cricsheet and cricinfo.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(cricketdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

## Loading Ball by Ball and Match Data for PSL 2016-Present from Cricsheet

``` r
PSL_Ball <- fetch_cricsheet(competition = "psl", gender = "male")

PSL_Match <- fetch_cricsheet("match", "psl", gender = "male")

PSL_Player <- fetch_cricsheet("player", "psl", gender = "male")
```

## Understanding the Structure
