# Pakistan Super League (PSL) Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of cricket matches from the Pakistan Super League (PSL). The project aims to uncover insights into team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes through various data visualization and statistical techniques.

## Project Structure
- `PSL Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd`: The R Markdown document containing the full analysis, from data loading and cleaning to in-depth exploration and visualization.
- `PSL-Exploratory-Data Analysis.pdf`: The PDF version of the analysis, which includes all outputs, charts, and interpretations, viewable directly in a web browser.

## How to View the Analysis
- **PDF Version**: For a quick and easy review, download `PSL-Exploratory-Data Analysis.pdf'. This document includes all the visualizations and findings without the need to run any code.
- **R Markdown Version**: To explore the analysis in depth, including the underlying code and methodology, open the `PSL Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd` file. This format is ideal if you wish to replicate the analysis, modify the code, or dive deeper into the data exploration process.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- R: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- R Libraries: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `cricketdata`.
- R Markdown: For creating dynamic documents that combine code, output, and narrative text.
